But the morning after the night before, when the rocker saw the dressing gown belt tied around a wardrobe rail in the ensuite of his Auckland hotel room, he was confronted with the reality he had attempted suicide. As he reveals in Working Class Man, the sequel to his best-selling Working Class Boy memoir, he had no recollection of getting out of bed and trying to take his life on that night in 2012. Confronting the evidence and confessing to wife Jane made him change his life forever, so he could keep living.</p>",  # noqa
